# Conformation_Analysis
Scripts used to perform conformation analysis including embedding and clustering.
## Package Requirements
alabtools(github.com/alberlab/alabtools), pickle, numpy, scipy, keras, tensorflow, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn
## How to Run
Models generated by the IGM should be placed under directory Model/ for further usage. For the GM12878 model, please refer to https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7352276. Partion files generated by the Markov Clustering Algorithm (MCL) should also be placed under directory Model/.
Script used to perform two-step embedding:
python 200kb_Autoencoder_Embedding.py GM 6 0 0 855
Script used to perform density-based clustering:
python Analysis_Gaussian_KDE_Autoencoder.py GM 6 0 855
The results will be generated under directory GM_Structural_Features/.
