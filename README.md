# Conformation_Analysis
Scripts used to perform conformation analysis including embedding and clustering.
## Package Requirements
- alabtools(github.com/alberlab/alabtools)
- pickle
- numpy
- scipy
- keras
- tensorflow
- sklearn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
## How to Run
Models generated by the IGM should be placed under directory Model/ for further usage. For the GM12878 model, please refer to https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7352276. Partion files generated by the Markov Clustering Algorithm (MCL) should also be placed under directory Model/.

Script used to perform two-step embedding:
```
python embedding.py <cell type> <chromosome index> <tag> <starting index> <ending index>
```
where cell type can be GM, H1 or HFF, chromosome index should be ranging from 1 to 23 (1 to 22 for H1 or HFF), tag is 0 or 1 if autoencoder is performed or not, starting index and ending index indicate the bead range. The following command line generate the embedding result for the whole chromosome 6 (bead index 0 to 854) of GM cell line:
```
python embedding.py GM 6 0 0 855
```

Script used to perform density-based clustering:
```
python analysis.py <cell type> <chromosome index> <starting index> <ending index>
```
Similarly, we can run the analysis based on the results generated by the embedding:
```
python analysis.py GM 6 0 855
```

The results will be generated under directory GM_Structural_Features/.
